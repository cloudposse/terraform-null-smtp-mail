## Introduction

This terraform module uses an external command using the [`local-exec`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/local-exec.html) provisioner to send emails. It's ideally suited for sending transactional emails
related to the `apply` phase. For example, notifying a user of their [IAM user account](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-user) getting created or the deployment of a new [ECS application](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-web-app).

**NOTE:** The `null` refers to the primary Terraform [provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/null/index.html) used in this module.

## Dependencies

  First install the latest release of the `email` cli tool here: https://github.com/wrouesnel/emailcli/releases

  Make sure it exists in your `PATH` (E.g. `/usr/local/bin`)

  We distribute an Alpine Linux package (`emailcli`) as part of our [toolchain](https://github.com/cloudposse/packages).

  ```
  curl -sSL https://apk.cloudposse.com/install.sh | sudo bash
  apk add emailcli@cloudposse
  ```



## Usage



> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation 
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic 
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.




```hcl
module "welcome" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-smtp-mail.git?ref=master"
  host       = "smtp.mailgun.org"
  port       = "587"
  username   = "postmaster@ourdomain.com"
  password   = "changeme"
  from       = "admin@yourdomain.com"
  to         = ["example@yourdomain.com"]
  subject    = "Welcome $${first_name}"
  body       = "Your account has been created. Login here: $${homepage}"

  vars = {
    first_name = "Example"
    homepage   = "https://cloudposse.com"
  }
}
```

__NOTE:__ Use the `file(...)` interpolation function to use a template file.
