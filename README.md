# terraform-null-smtp-mail [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-null-smtp-mail.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-null-smtp-mail) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-null-smtp-mail.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-smtp-mail/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform Module to send emails using an SMTP server by calling an external `email` command.


---

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).









## Introduction

This terraform module uses an external command using the [`local-exec`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/local-exec.html) provisioner to send emails. It's ideally suited for sending transactional emails
related to the `apply` phase. For example, notifying a user of their [IAM user account](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-user) getting created or the deployment of a new [ECS application](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-web-app).

**NOTE:** The `null` refers to the primary Terraform [provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/null/index.html) used in this module.

## Dependencies

  First install the latest release of the `email` cli tool here: https://github.com/wrouesnel/emailcli/releases

  Make sure it exists in your `PATH` (E.g. `/usr/local/bin`)

  We distribute an Alpine Linux package (`emailcli`) as part of our [toolchain](https://github.com/cloudposse/packages).

  ```
  curl -sSL https://apk.cloudposse.com/install.sh | sudo bash
  apk add emailcli@cloudposse
  ```

## Usage


```hcl
module "welcome" {
  source     = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-smtp-mail.git?ref=master"
  host       = "smtp.mailgun.org"
  port       = "587"
  username   = "postmaster@ourdomain.com"
  password   = "changeme"
  from       = "admin@yourdomain.com"
  to         = ["example@yourdomain.com"]
  subject    = "Welcome $${first_name}"
  body       = "Your account has been created. Login here: $${homepage}"

  vars = {
    first_name = "Example"
    homepage   = "https://cloudposse.com"
  }
}
```

__NOTE:__ Use the `file(...)` interpolation function to use a template file.
