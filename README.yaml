# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform Module to send emails using an SMTP server by calling an external `email` command.

introduction: |-
  This terraform module uses an external command using the [`local-exec`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/local-exec.html) provisioner to send emails. It's ideally suited for sending transactional emails
  related to the `apply` phase. For example, notifying a user of their [IAM user account](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-user) getting created or the deployment of a new [ECS application](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-web-app).
  
  **NOTE:** The `null` refers to the primary Terraform [provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/null/index.html) used in this module.

  ## Dependencies

    First install the latest release of the `email` cli tool here: https://github.com/wrouesnel/emailcli/releases

    Make sure it exists in your `PATH` (E.g. `/usr/local/bin`)

    We distribute an Alpine Linux package (`emailcli`) as part of our [toolchain](https://github.com/cloudposse/packages).

    ```
    curl -sSL https://apk.cloudposse.com/install.sh | sudo bash
    apk add emailcli@cloudposse
    ```
